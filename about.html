	  	I obtained a degree in Electrical Engineering from Louisiana Tech and worked as a Software Engineer in the 1990s.  I left the profession to stay home with my two daughters.  After becoming a single mom, I obtained my Master’s degree in Education and went back to work as a public school teacher – mainly teaching Math and Science.  This type of profession, although extremely challenging, allowed me to keep the same schedule as my daughters which helped ease the transition to our new situation.</p>

		<div class="bg-1 row" style="padding: 20px">I have greatly missed the intellectual stimulation of computer science so I applied and received the Grow with Google Challenge scholarship in partnership with the website Udacity.  I completed the Front End Web Developer Program in 2018.  My intention was to explore my programming abilities and begin to update my skills.  I enjoyed it so much that I've continued my professional development through other MOOC(massive open online courses) such as DataCamp, Coursera, and Udemy.  I've also recently enrolled in a local code immersion program through Tech Talent South.  We will be reviewing HTML and CSS while learning Ruby on Rails to develop a full-stack application.

		<div class="bg-1 row" style="padding: 20px">I plan to continue my professional development and return to a Software Engineering role.  After completing the Code Immersion course through Tech Talent South and the Java Masterclass through Udemy I would like to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and its associated libaries/frameworks-Node.JS, React, etc.  I would also like to continue learning to manage and visualize big data using R as well as Python.  Ultimately, I will develop an application that runs on all major platforms-IOS, Android, Windows, etc..  My goal is obtain a position that allows me to design and develop applications while also becoming a leader and educator in the profession.
